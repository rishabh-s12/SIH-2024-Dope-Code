                <p>Major events about <a href="#content" class="highlight-link">Anti Doping Campaigns.</a></p>
                <p>Anti-doping campaigns and protests focus on promoting fair play and integrity in sports by fighting against the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). These efforts involve educating athletes, coaches, and the public about the dangers and consequences of doping, including health risks, ethical violations, and legal repercussions. Campaigns often advocate for stricter regulations, rigorous testing, and transparent enforcement to ensure a level playing field. They also promote the values of honesty and clean sportsmanship, encouraging athletes to compete without the use of banned substances. Protests and public demonstrations sometimes accompany these campaigns, calling attention to doping issues and demanding more stringent anti-doping measures.

                <h2>Whistleblowers and Exposés</h2>
                <p>Examples:
                    Lance Armstrong Scandal (2012): Although not a traditional protest, the actions of whistleblowers like Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton, who exposed Lance Armstrong's extensive doping program, led to widespread condemnation and protests against the culture of doping in cycling.</p>
                <p>Russian Doping Scandal (2016): Whistleblowers like Yuliya Stepanova and Grigory Rodchenkov exposed state-sponsored doping in Russia, leading to protests by athletes and anti-doping advocates, including calls for banning Russian athletes from international competitions.

                <h2>Athletes Returning Medals</h2>
                <p>Cathy Freeman (2000 Sydney Olympics): Although not related directly to doping, Australian runner Cathy Freeman’s decision to return her gold medal as a gesture of reconciliation can be seen as symbolic. In doping cases, some clean athletes have considered or threatened to return their medals in protest of losing to athletes later found guilty of doping. </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Athletes’ Public Statements and Social Media Campaigns</h2>
                <p>"I Compete Clean" Campaigns: Many athletes have publicly declared their commitment to clean sport by participating in campaigns like "I Compete Clean" and "Clean Sport Collective." These campaigns often involve athletes making public pledges against doping, wearing symbolic items, or posting on social media to raise awareness.

                <h2>Official Boycotts and Exclusions</h2>
                <p>Boycott of Doping-Tainted Events: Some national teams and athletes have refused to participate in events where they believed doping was rampant or not adequately addressed. For example, in the early 2000s, there were discussions among several national Olympic committees about boycotting events in protest of perceived leniency towards doping offenders.
                </p>
                <p>Exclusion of Doping Nations: In response to widespread doping, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and other sports organizations have excluded entire nations or teams from competition. This action itself can be seen as a form of protest against systemic doping, as seen in the partial bans of Russian athletes from the 2016 Rio Olympics and the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang.
                </p>
                <p>WADA's Stance on Russian Doping (2016-2020): The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) took a strong stance against Russian doping by recommending a ban on Russian athletes from international competition. This move was a significant protest against state-sponsored doping and led to debates and protests in the global sports community.

Protests (Various Locations): Anti-doping advocacy groups and fans have organized public demonstrations under slogans like "No Doping!" to raise awareness and demand stronger action against doping. These protests have often coincided with major sporting events, such as the Olympics and World Championships.
