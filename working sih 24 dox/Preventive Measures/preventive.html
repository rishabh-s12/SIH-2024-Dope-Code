            <h1>Preventive Measures</h1>
            <p>In recent years, authorities and organizations have implemented a variety of measures to combat doping in
                sports, reflecting a commitment to ensuring fair play and athlete health. Here are some of the key steps
                taken:</p>

                <p class="image-text"><h2>Enhanced Testing Procedures</h2><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Biological Passport Program: The Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) monitors an athlete’s biological markers over time, allowing authorities to detect abnormal variations that may indicate doping, even in the absence of a positive drug test. This method has been widely adopted by various sports organizations, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI)​(International Testing Agency).</li>
                    <li>Increased Out-of-Competition Testing: Anti-doping agencies have ramped up out-of-competition testing, which is crucial as athletes are more likely to use PEDs during training periods. Surprise testing helps deter athletes from doping when they think they are not being monitored​(Olympics).</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="image-text"><h2>Improved Detection Techniques</h2><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Advanced Analytical Methods: Laboratories have developed more sophisticated techniques for detecting newer forms of doping, including the use of mass spectrometry and genetic testing. These technologies allow for the identification of microdoses of banned substances and the detection of substances that were previously undetectable​(World Anti Doping Agency).</li>
                    <li>Long-Term Sample Storage: Authorities have implemented policies that allow for the long-term storage and re-analysis of samples. This means that samples from major events like the Olympics can be retested years later as detection methods improve, leading to retrospective action against dopers​(International Testing Agency).</li>
                </ul></p>

                <p class="image-text"><h2>Increased Collaboration and Intelligence Sharing</h2><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>International Cooperation: Anti-doping efforts have become more global, with organizations like WADA, the International Testing Agency (ITA), and national anti-doping organizations (NADOs) working together. Intelligence sharing between agencies has been key in uncovering large-scale doping operations, such as the Russian state-sponsored doping scandal​(International Testing Agency, Olympics).</li>
                    <li>Whistleblower Programs: Authorities have established and promoted whistleblower programs that encourage individuals to report doping violations. WADA’s "Speak Up!" program is one such initiative that has led to the exposure of doping networks​(World Anti Doping Agency).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Athlete Education Programs: There has been a significant focus on educating athletes, coaches, and support staff about the dangers of doping and the importance of clean sport. These programs aim to instill ethical values and provide information on the risks associated with PEDs​(International Testing Agency).</li>
                    <li>Outreach to Youth and Grassroots Levels: Recognizing that doping issues often begin early in an athlete's career, authorities have extended educational and preventive efforts to youth and amateur sports levels. This approach helps prevent doping before it becomes ingrained in competitive cultures​(Olympics).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Anti-Doping Apps: Mobile applications have been developed to help athletes check the status of medications and supplements to ensure they are not taking banned substances. These tools have been valuable in preventing inadvertent doping​(World Anti Doping Agency).</li>
                    <li>Data Analytics: Big data and artificial intelligence are increasingly used to identify doping patterns, such as unusual performance improvements or suspicious behavior, which can trigger targeted testing​(International Testing Agency).</li>
