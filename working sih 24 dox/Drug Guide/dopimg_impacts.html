        <h1>Impacts of Doping on the Body</h1>
        <p>Doping, particularly the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), can have severe long-term effects on the body. While these substances might offer short-term gains in athletic performance, their prolonged use can lead to significant health issues, including both physical and psychological problems.</p>

    <h2>Cardiovascular Issues</h2>
    <div class="disease">
        <div>
            <h3>Hypertension and Heart Disease</h3>
            <p>Many PEDs, especially anabolic steroids, can cause high blood pressure and contribute to the development of heart disease...</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Cardiomyopathy</h3>
            <p>Long-term use of anabolic steroids can lead to a condition called cardiomyopathy, where the heart muscle becomes enlarged and weakened...</p>

    <h2>2. Liver Damage</h2>

        <div>
            <h3>Liver Toxicity</h3>
            <p>Oral anabolic steroids are particularly harmful to the liver, leading to liver toxicity and even liver cancer in severe cases. Conditions like hepatic adenomas (benign tumors) and peliosis hepatis (blood-filled cysts in the liver) can develop​.</p>

    <h2>3. Reproductive and Hormonal Imbalances</h2>
    <div class="disease">
        <img src="fertility issues.jpeg" alt="infertility">
        <div>
            <h3>Infertility and Sexual Dysfunction</h3>
            <p>In males, anabolic steroids can cause testicular atrophy (shrinking of the testicles), reduced sperm production, and infertility. In females, these substances can lead to menstrual irregularities and the development of male characteristics (virilization), such as deepened voice and facial hair growth​.</p>

    <div class="disease">
        <img src="gynecomastia.jpeg" alt="Gynecomastia">
        <div>
            <h3>Gynecomastia</h3>
            <p>Males may develop gynecomastia, or the growth of breast tissue, due to hormonal imbalances caused by steroid use​.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>4. Musculoskeletal Problems</h2>
    <div class="disease">
        <img src="Tendon images.jpeg" alt="Tendon">
        <div>
            <h3>Tendon Injuries</h3>
            <p>Anabolic steroids can lead to an increase in muscle mass that outpaces the strength of the tendons, leading to a higher risk of tendon injuries, which can be debilitating and require long recovery times​.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Psychological Effects</h2>
    <div class="disease">
        <img src="mood disorder.jpeg" alt="Mood Disorder">
        <div>
            <h3>Mood Disorders</h3>
            <p>Long-term use of PEDs, particularly anabolic steroids, can lead to psychological issues such as aggression (often referred to as "roid rage"), depression, anxiety, and in some cases, psychosis. The withdrawal phase can also trigger severe depression and suicidal thoughts​.</p>

            <h3>Addiction</h3>
            <p>There is also a risk of developing an addiction to these substances, leading to a cycle of dependency that can be challenging to break​.</p>
        </div>

    <h2>6. Increased Risk of Infections</h2>
    <div class="disease">
        <img src="aids.avif" alt="HIV/AIDS">
        <div>
            <h3>HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis</h3>
            <p>For those who inject PEDs, there is an increased risk of contracting blood-borne infections such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis if needles are shared​.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>7. Immune System Suppression</h2>
    <div class="disease">
        <div>
            <h3>Weakened Immunity</h3>
            <p>Some PEDs can suppress the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and other diseases​.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While the short-term benefits of doping may be tempting for athletes seeking to enhance their performance, the long-term health consequences are severe and often irreversible. The risks include life-threatening conditions like heart disease, liver damage, and psychological disorders, which far outweigh any temporary gains in performance. The medical and sports communities continue to advocate against doping, emphasizing the importance of clean competition and the health risks associated with PED use.</p>
