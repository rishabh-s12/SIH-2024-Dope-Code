                    <h2>Ben Johnson (1988)</h2>
                    <p>Ben Johnson, a Canadian sprinter, won the 100 meters gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics with a
                        record time of 9.79 seconds. However, just days later, he tested positive for stanozolol, an
                        anabolic steroid.</p>
                    <p>As a result, he was stripped of his gold medal, and the title was awarded to Carl Lewis, the
                        American sprinter who finished second. Johnson's case became one of the most notorious doping
                        scandals in Olympic history.

                    <h3>Anti-doping cases in the past</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Anti-doping cases involve incidents where athletes are found to
                            have violated anti-doping regulations by using prohibited substances or methods to enhance
                            performance. </li>
                        <li><strong>Conclusion of such cases:</strong>The detection of such violations can result in
                            sanctions, including fines, suspensions, or permanent bans from competition. They can have
                            significant implications for athletes' careers, reputations, and the integrity of the sport.

                <h3>Lance Armstrong (1999-2005)</h3>
                <p>Lance Armstrong, an American cyclist, was a seven-time Tour de France winner. However, in 2012, an
                    investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) revealed that Armstrong had used
                    performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career. Armstrong eventually admitted to doping in a
                    televised interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2013. As a result, he was stripped of all his Tour de
                    France titles and banned from professional cycling for life.

                        at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. In 2007, Jones admitted to using steroids before the Olympics as
                        part of the BALCO scandal. She was subsequently stripped of her Olympic medals, and her career
                        was tarnished by the scandal. Jones also served a six-month prison sentence for lying to federal

                    drug for health reasons but claimed she was unaware it had been banned. Initially suspended for two
                    years, her ban was later reduced to 15 months following an appeal. She returned to professional
                    tennis in April 2017.

                    positive for a banned diuretic just before the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Warne claimed that the drug
                    was given to him by his mother to help him lose weight, not to enhance performance. Despite this
                    defense, he was banned from cricket for 12 months by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB). Warne
                    returned to cricket after his ban and continued his successful career.
